Technology & Tools :- Jupyter, Spyder, Visual Studio Code, Nimblebox, TensorFlow, Keras, Google Colab, Kaggle, Python, Rasa, Github.

Worked on below Machine Learning Projects.

1) Lending Case Study - A lending company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

2) Investment Funding - The investment company wants to find the out best investment type & sector to invest within the budget range of 5 â€“ 15 Million USD in top 3 countries. Used Python, Data Pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA, Data Visualization techniques etc.

3) Car Price Prediction - Built a model to find out significant features in predicting the price of a car which can help the Car Manufacturing Company to manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Used Linear Regression model, EDA etc.

4) Telecom Churn Prediction - To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn ie; ordinary or HNI Customers. Also need to find out the various reasons/features for customer churn which can help telecom company to take necessary action to retain customers. Used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SGD, SVM, PCA etc.

5) POS Tagging Case Study - Solved the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc.

6) Rasa Chat Bot - A restaurant search Chabot. The bot will be able to 'talk' to users in English, and will help them search for restaurants offering multiple cuisines, suiting different budgets, etc.

7) Neural Network Case Study - Built a complete neural network using Numpy. Implemented all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates, hyper-parameter tuning etc.

8) Gesture Recognition - Developed a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

Thumbs up: Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
Stop: Pause the movie

9) Cab Driver - Reinforcement Learning

10) Restricted Boltzmann Machine to perform Topic Modelling on a set of Amazon reviews. It is an unsupervised problem.
